                Tilde is, in its most simple form, a note taking app, though saying Tilde is just a note taking app is a little bit of an understatement. Tilde is a student-orientated note taking application for power users.

                A school notebook should be an organized collection of paper you use to keep all of your handouts and class notes in a way that makes them easy to retrieve undamaged. This, obviously, isn't the case. Notebooks have forever been a struggle whether it
                be keeping them clean or doing something as simple as <em>not ruining it</em>. Tilde aims to fix all of these problems by replacing your notebook with your phone, tablet or computer.

                But why Tilde? There are plenty of note taking applications out there, why not choose one of them? My device comes with a note taking app preloaded! The answer is simple: Tilde was designed to be used in environments, whether they be school or work,
                where you need to take more comprehensive notes. Can you name five features your preloaded note-taking application has? With support for Markdown and HTML, advanced filters and more, it simply can't keep up. It wasn't made to.

                When four students got together to invent a product that would make the life of community members easier, the "eBinder" was one of the early suggestions. In the end, the idea didn't make the cut. In fact, the entire project fell apart shortly after.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a few months, the project was reintroduced to the school and the app was re-envisioned as Tilde. This time, all profits made off the product would be going to charity. With the group finalized, the original eBinder evolved into today's Tilde.

                Tilde is currently not available online, though it will be making its debut in the near future. Price and location TBA, with all profits going to charity.
