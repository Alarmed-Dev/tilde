# tilde ~ 1.0
The student's note taking app of the future.

Tilde is a student-orientated, hyper-organized note taking application for power users, first created as a school project.

## What is Tilde?

Tilde was built on the foundational idea of an "eNotebook", or a hardware / software replacement for a traditional notebook used in school environments.

## Building Tilde

To build Tilde locally, you will need to install Cordova and all of the dependancies.

```
$ npm install -g cordova
```

```
$ cordova platform add android
```

```
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-calendar && cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-dialogs && cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing
```
